## Frontend Best Practices

### 1.1 Input Validation

Input validation ensures that users provide valid data before processing it. For instance, validating that a task title has at least 3 characters before enabling the save button.

```tsx
const isSaveDisabled = disabled || inputValue.length < 3;

<Button
  onClick={onSaveTask}
  className="mt-6 bg-blue-500 text-white font-semibold py-2 px-4 rounded-md"
  disabled={isSaveDisabled}
  text="Save Task"
/>;
```

**Why:** Ensures that users cannot submit incomplete or invalid data, reducing errors and improving user experience.

### 1.2 Type Safety

Using TypeScript for type safety helps catch errors during development, improving code reliability.

```tsx
interface TaskInputProps {
  inputValue: string;
  descriptionValue: string;
  onInputChange: (value: string) => void;
  onDescriptionChange: (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => void;
  onSaveTask: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

**Why:** Ensures that components receive the correct types of props, preventing runtime errors and making the code easier to understand and maintain.

### 1.3 Controlled Components

Controlled components are components whose value is controlled by React state, ensuring a single source of truth for the input data.

```tsx
<Input
  value={inputValue}
  onChange={(e) => onInputChange(e.target.value)}
  placeholder="Develop better habits"
  disabled={disabled}
/>
```

**Why:** Provides better control over form elements, enabling more complex form behaviors and validations.

### 1.4 Debouncing API Calls

Debouncing helps to limit the number of API calls made while the user is typing, reducing unnecessary network requests and improving performance.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    fetchData(inputValue);
  }, 500);

  return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
}, [inputValue]);
```

**Why:** Reduces the load on both the client and the server by minimizing unnecessary API calls, especially when the user is rapidly typing.

### 1.5 Handling Asynchronous Data

Proper handling of asynchronous data with `async/await` ensures that the UI behaves predictably while waiting for data.

```tsx
const handleSaveTask = async () => {
  setLoadingSubtasks(true);
  setSubtasks([]);

  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/generate-tasks', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        title: inputValue,
        description: descriptionValue,
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    setSubtasks(data.subtasks);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating subtasks:', error);
  } finally {
    setLoadingSubtasks(false);
  }
};
```

**Why:** Ensures that the user interface remains responsive and that errors are handled gracefully.

### 1.6 Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS

Using Tailwind CSS classes to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

```tsx
<div className="mx-auto w-full max-w-7xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
  <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center w-full mb-8">
    <TaskInput
      inputValue={inputValue}
      descriptionValue={descriptionValue}
      onInputChange={setInputValue}
      onDescriptionChange={setDescriptionValue}
      onSaveTask={() => {}}
    />
  </div>
</div>
```

**Why:** Enhances user experience across various devices by ensuring that the UI adjusts properly to different screen sizes.

### 1.7 Event Handling

Passing the entire event object when handling events to ensure that all necessary data is available.

```tsx
const handleInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => {
  const newValue = e.target.value.slice(0, maxLength);
  onChange(e);
  setCharCount(newValue.length);
};
```

**Why:** Ensures that the event handler can access all properties of the event object, leading to more flexible and robust code.

## Backend Best Practices

### 2.1 Error Handling

Implementing error handling in the backend to catch and handle exceptions, ensuring that the API returns meaningful error messages.

```ts
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const { title, description } = await req.json();
    const subtasks = await generateSubtasksFromChatGPT(title, description);

    return NextResponse.json({ subtasks });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating subtasks:', error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { message: 'An error occurred while generating subtasks.' },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

**Why:** Provides better debugging information and a smoother user experience by preventing unhandled errors from crashing the application.

### 2.2 Delayed Execution with Promises

Simulating delays in API responses to mimic real-world scenarios and test application behavior under different conditions.

```ts
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
```

**Why:** Allows developers to test the application's responsiveness and user experience under conditions that are closer to production environments.

### 2.3 Data Validation

Validating incoming data on the server to ensure that it meets the expected format and constraints before processing it.

```ts
const { title, description } = await req.json();
if (!title || title.length < 3) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { message: 'Title must be at least 3 characters long.' },
    { status: 400 }
  );
}
```

**Why:** Prevents invalid data from entering the system, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring data integrity.

### 2.4 SQL Queries and Database Security

Using SQL best practices, such as using parameterized queries and implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) policies, to protect the database from unauthorized access.

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to manage tasks"
  ON public.tasks
  FOR ALL
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**Why:** Enhances security by ensuring that users can only access and modify the data they own, reducing the risk of data breaches.

### 2.5 Row-Level Security in Supabase

Enabling Row-Level Security (RLS) in Supabase to ensure that users can only access the data they are authorized to view.

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Why:** Provides fine-grained access control at the row level, ensuring that data is securely partitioned based on user roles and permissions.

## Additional Project Details

### Placeholder Code and Basic Functionality

The current codebase includes a significant amount of placeholder code intended to demonstrate ideas, layout, and general structure. These placeholders help visualize the intended design and functionality, allowing for future refinement and expansion. Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations have been implemented, providing foundational functionality for managing tasks and subtasks. Additionally, basic authentication has been set up, allowing users to register, log in, and access protected routes.

### Backend Tables and Relationships

The backend database schema includes several tables designed to support the task management functionality:

- **Tasks Table**: Stores all tasks created by users, including fields for title, description, start date, due date, and completion status.
- **Tags Table**: Stores tags that can be associated with tasks for better organization and filtering.
- **Task Tags Join Table**: Manages the many-to-many relationship between tasks and tags, allowing each task to be associated with multiple tags and vice versa.
- **Task Relationships Table**: Manages relationships between tasks, enabling subtasks or dependent tasks to be linked to a parent task. This setup supports hierarchical task management.

All tables have been configured with row-level security (RLS) using SQL queries. RLS ensures that users can only access data they are authorized to view or modify. This security model is crucial for maintaining data privacy and integrity, especially in a multi-user environment.
